Thanks for asking me to work on this. I will get started on it and keep this PR's description up to date as I form a plan and make progress.

> full Solana validator in Zig 0.15. Scope includes Leader and Verifier roles. Key features are Proof of History (PoH) generation/verification, Proof of Stake (PoS) for active voting and leader election, an SBF/eBPF interpreter for smart contracts, and Proof of Replication (PoRep) for storage proofs. The multi-phase plan covers initial setup, core PoH implementation, consensus and state execution, PoRep, and final optimization for a feature-complete validator, gRPC API.

## Task
Study https://ziglang.org/ closely and build ziglana.org modeled after it. Use the same font stack, color palette, button styles, container widths, and spacing from ziglang.org CSS. Ziglana = Zig community building AI and crypto on Solana. Include: hero section with gradient background, 6-card feature grid, code example with syntax highlighting, getting started section, community links (GitHub, Discord, X/Twitter). Must be a complete, polished static site (HTML + CSS + JS). Write complete file contents for index.html, style.css, and script.js.
