Thanks for asking me to work on this. I will get started on it and keep this PR's description up to date as I form a plan and make progress.

Original description:

> full Solana validator in Zig 0.15. Scope includes Leader and Verifier roles. Key features are Proof of History (PoH) generation/verification, Proof of Stake (PoS) for active voting and leader election, an SBF/eBPF interpreter for smart contracts, and Proof of Replication (PoRep) for storage proofs. The multi-phase plan covers initial setup, core PoH implementation, consensus and state execution, PoRep, and final optimization for a feature-complete validator, gRPC API.

## Task
Build a modern static website for ziglana.org - a Zig community focused on AI and crypto on Solana. Model it after ziglang.org but with Solana/crypto/AI branding. Include: landing page with hero section, features grid (Zig + Solana speed, AI inference, crypto primitives), getting started guide, community links, dark theme, responsive design. Use plain HTML/CSS/JS - no frameworks. Make it production-ready.


## Findings
The output shows a `.git` directory, `LICENSE`, and `README.md`. There's no package manager file (like `package.json`, `dub.sdl`, etc.). Since the task specifies using plain HTML/CSS/JS without frameworks, I don't expect any package managers to be involved.

**STEP 2: Fetch Documentation (Skipped)**

Since the task explicitly states to use plain HTML/CSS/JS without frameworks, I'll skip fetching documentation for external libraries or system APIs.

**STEP 3: Fill Knowledge Gaps**

I will skip this step as well, as the stack is assumed to be well-known.

**Summary:**

1.  **Package versions:** N/A (no package managers used).
2.  **Correct import paths and function signatures:** N/A (no external libraries).
3.  **API endpoints and request/response formats:** N/A.
4.  **Project structure conventions:** Based on the `ls` output, the project appears to be a basic git repository with a license and README. A `.devwork` directory also exists, which may contain development-related files (though this isn't standard).
5.  **Common gotchas or version-specific issues:** N/A. The project will use plain HTML, CSS, and JS, so there shouldn't be any version-specific issues related to frameworks or libraries.
